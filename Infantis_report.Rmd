## Overall Impressions  

>  This dataset presents some very interesting challenges.  Each room appears to have a very different microbiome when compared to the others.  These differences are likely partially due to the different treatments assigned to each room, but we also cannot disregard the room effect.  

> Because these birds spent almost 2 months isolated in these rooms, we would expect the birds within rooms to be more similar to each other when compared to birds from other rooms.  I suspect that two rooms of birds treated identically byt isolated for 60 days would contain appreciably different microbial communities. Overall this means we need to be careful when discussing our findings.  



## Methods and QC


- ASVs were generated with DADA2  
- Phylogenetic classification with SILVA v138 
- Decontamination was performed with the R package 'decontam'  
  - Removes likely contaminants by examining negative control samples  
- Examined overall similarity and removed a few poorly performing samples.

## Speculation Zone  

> Very interesting... Vaccines are associated with higher levels of Salmonella Infantis in the Cecal contents

> We observe significantly higher Salmonella Shedding in both AviPro and BBS866 vaccinated groups compared to Mock Vaccinated Infantis challenged group.

> We observe large differences in bacterial communities from cecal contents when comparing Infantis infected groups back to mock-infected controls.  The mock vaccinated are the most similar to the mock-challenged and both vaccine groups are quite different from the mock vaccine and each other.

> One way this could be interpreted is that each vaccine enhanced the 'Salmonella effect' on microbial communities.

> In summary, not only is vaccination associated with worse colonization, it is also associated with greater difference in microbial communities after Salmonella Infantis infection.


#### Wild Speculation zone:
> Could it be that being vaccinated enhanced the inflammatory immune response?
So when salmonella was encountered again, this enhanced immune response increased gut inflammation (which Salmonella loves) allowed more extensive colonization?

> Alternatively, could vaccination have effected microbial communities? Then these changed microbial communities were less effective at excluding Salmonella upon infection?
