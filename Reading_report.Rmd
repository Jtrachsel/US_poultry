## Outline  
  
1. Mock Reading vs Mock Mock  
2. Mreading vs BBS866
3. Mreading vs AVIPRO  

## Mock Reading vs Mock Mock {.tabset}  
  
> E. Reading Challenge effect on turkey microbiome
Samples: Mock-vaccinated/mock-challenged and mock-vaccinated/Reading-challenged @ 2,7, 14, 21 dpi
Question: did challenge with Salmonella Reading alter the microbial composition of the turkey cecum (cecal contents)  
  
  
  
### Summary  
  
It is difficult to generate a robust answer to this question with the current data.    
  
Hard to say what the 'challenge' effect is with this subset.  Before challenge both groups are already quite different from each other.  Furthermore, over the course of the challenge both groups change quite a bit, not just the Reading infected group.  
  
- mock mock changes a lot
- mock Reading changes a lot
- Both rooms start out quite different from each other.

### OTHER
***I donâ€™t plan to necessarily compare the vaccines to one another, but instead create 2 manuscripts (if all the data allow). Although, it might be interesting to know, if both vaccines alter the microbiota, do they do it similarly; i.e.:
  1. Compare in A: comparison #1 & #2
2. Compare F to G on the corresponding dpi
