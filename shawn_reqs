***I donâ€™t plan to necessarily compare the vaccines to one another, but instead create 2 manuscripts (if all the data allow). Although, it might be interesting to know, if both vaccines alter the microbiota, do they do it similarly; i.e.:
1. Compare in A: comparison #1 & #2
2. Compare F to G on the corresponding dpi
